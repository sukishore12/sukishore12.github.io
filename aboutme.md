Hi! I'm Sulekha (su-lay-ka) Kishore, a fourth-year undergraduate at Caltech. I'm studying Computer Science and Political Science. I'm interested in exploring algorithmic fairness and equitable decision-making in ML models. AT Caltech, I've been fortunate to have worked with Prof. [Mike Alvarez] (https://www.hss.caltech.edu/people/r-michael-alvarez), Prof. [Adam Wierman] (https://www.cms.caltech.edu/people/adamw), and Prof. [Soon-Jo Chung] (https://www.eas.caltech.edu/people/sjchung). 

Outside of academics, I captain Caltech's ulitmate frisbee team (go Aftermath!), love surfing, and to go hiking. I'm involved with the Caltech Y, especially through the Student Activism Speaker Series. I also organize the Southern California Science Olympiad State Tournament through Caltech Science Olympiad Planning team.
