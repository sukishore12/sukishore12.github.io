<br>Hi! I'm Sulekha (su-lay-ka) Kishore, a fourth-year undergraduate at <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/">Caltech</a>, 
where I'm studying Computer SCience and Political Science. 
I'm interested in exploring algorithmic fairness and equitable decision-making in ML models
At Caltech, I've been fortunate to have worked with Prof. <a href="https://www.hss.caltech.edu/people/r-michael-alvarez">Mike Alvarez</a>, 
Prof. <a href="https://www.cms.caltech.edu/people/adamw">Adam Wierman</a>, and 
Prof. <a href="https://www.eas.caltech.edu/people/sjchung">Soon-Jo Chung</a>.<br><br>

Outside of academics, I captain Caltech's ulitmate frisbee team (go Aftermath!), love surfing, and to go hiking. 
I'm involved with the Caltech Y, especially through the Student Activism Speaker Series.
I also organize the Southern California Science Olympiad State Tournament through Caltech Science Olympiad Planning team.
