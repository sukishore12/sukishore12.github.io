It's been awhile since I've tried to explain the eye to 2nd graders! In November, members of the Caltech Science Olympiad Planning Team went out to a local La Canada elementary school to help with their science night. 

Our table had a build-a-motor setup that two of the SciOly students created and I had a set that explained how the eye aligns light, using a variety of differently shaped lens pieces to illustrate how focal points and refraction work together to create clear vision. While many of the kids seemed to enjoy more just playing with the reflections and refractions (and many of the parents said "oh that's how glasses work!").
