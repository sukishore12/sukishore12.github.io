This past December, I had the opportunity to organize and go on the Caltech Y's DC Science Policy Trip! As one of the student organizers, I was super excited to see 4+ months of organizing translate into real life. We had 4 days of packed with sessions with many Caltech alums in various aspects of science policy.

Our first session was with Dr. Arati Prabhakar, Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. After a quick introduction from Dr. Prabhakar, the rest of session was open questions from our group. In our group of 21 students, we had a roughly even splitof graduate and undergraduate students.
